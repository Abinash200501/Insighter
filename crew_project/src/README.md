### Usage

1. Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run main.py
Enter your query in the input box.
The app will:
Classify the query
Search the web
Retrieve and structure content
Summarize the information
Results are displayed in the app and automatically saved as a Markdown file under the output/ folder.

## How it works
Query Classification

Determines the type of query (e.g., Education, How-To, News, Product Info, General Knowledge).

Uses a CrewAI agent with LLM for intent analysis.

Web Search and Content Retrieval

Web search is performed using the SerperDev tool.

Structured content is extracted from websites using a scraping agent (ScrapeWebsiteTool).

Summarization and Output

Content is summarized using the LLM agent to produce concise, readable summaries.

Summaries are saved as Markdown files for easy reference.

CrewAI Workflow

Query is classified by the classifier agent

Relevant sources are fetched by the web searcher agent

Structured data is extracted by the retriever agent

Summaries are generated by the summarizer agent

Results are stored in Markdown under output/
