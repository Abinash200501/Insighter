They are easy to understand and present material relevant to the IBPS PO syllabus and also give ample practice questions. Here is a subject-wise list of the best IBPS PO preparation books:\\\\nEnglish Language: Though no books apart from the traditional IBPS guides seem relevant to the PO exam at first glance, almost all the concepts covered in both stages of the examination are from these books:\\\\nHigh School English Grammar and Composition by Wren and Martin. Reading this book will also improve the knowledge level and proficiency in the English language. This book is also relevant for the English descriptive test in the IBPS Probationary Officer main exam.\\\\nHow to Read Better and Faster by Norman Lewis\\\\nReading Comprehension, Ordering of Sentences, Ordering of Words and Cloze Test by Dilip Khushwaha\\\\nQuantitative Aptitude: There is a multitude of books available for the Quantitative Aptitude section of the syllabus as it is common to PO and management entrance exams.

Some useful books for this subject are:\\\\nIndia Year Book by Publications Division, Government of India\\\\nBanking Awareness by B.K Raut and S.R Behera\\\\nApart from these books, The Hindu and Indian Express are good sources of information on the latest developments. The focus should be on the business and world news sections of these newspapers.\\\\nPratiyogita Darpan (Monthly Edition)\\\\nRelated Links:\\\\nLogical Reasoning\\\\nLogical Reasoning Questions and Answers\\\\nComputer Knowledge\\\\nBanking Awareness\\\\nGeneral English for Competitive Exams\\\\nVerbal Ability\\\\nCandidates can know the detailed section-wise bank exam syllabus at the linked article.\\\\nThe books listed above are more than sufficient to crack the public sector bank PO exam.
